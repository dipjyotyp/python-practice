Cost of each ticket in a ticket counter is 25 dollars and the counter has no initial money. Each person in the queue has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollar bill.
Write a function to determine if the clerk can sell tickets to every person and give change based on the bills the people have in the queue.
Return YES if he can else NO.

Example:
tickets [25, 25, 50]			-->		YES 
tickets [25, 100]				-->		NO
tickets [25, 25, 50, 50, 100]	--> 	NO
